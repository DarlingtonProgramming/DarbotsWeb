    <p>The best achievement, the most beautiful sceneries and the most suffering things is only a tiny little part of this universe. So we decide, wherever we achieve in the future, our final goal is to fuel the development of the human beings.</p>
    <p>We have never been lack of the power of innovation inside our group, but we may give up our amibitions and stop fighting for it. How many people does not fully understand one programming language and goes to another? </p>
