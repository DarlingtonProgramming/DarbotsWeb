<div class="mt-5 mb-5">
    <p>A lot of times, FTC teams face huge problems upgrading their Driver Station APP versions because managing a Google account for Google Play is time-consuming and torturing</p>
    <p>Especially in a school environment which the wifis have filters on - installing CA certs, and logging to the WIFI via 802.1X on DS phones are pains that teams must overcome.</p>
    <p>Thus today we released our utilities for upgrading DS APPs via a USB connection with a Mac / Windows Computer.</p>
    <p>The codes can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/DarlingtonProgramming/Darbots-DriverStation-Utilities">Here</a></p>
