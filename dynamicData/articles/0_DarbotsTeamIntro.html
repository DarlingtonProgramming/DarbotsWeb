    <h3>Main Theory</h3>
    <p>Determination, Passion, Encouragement, Gracious Professionalism</p>
    <p>Darbots is a team that participates in the robotics competition, First Tech Challenge</p>
    <p>Darbots is a diverse group of students, grades 6-12, with a passion to develop their talents and abilities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. But our mission does not stop here. Darbots is constantly involved in making an impact in the STEM community.</p>

    <h3>Team Structure</h3>
    <p>The team is divded into 4 different subteams, each having their different responsibilities.</p>
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p class="lead">Programming</p>
                <p>The programming subteam programs for every robot prototype and maintains the <a href="https://github.com/DarlingtonProgramming/FTC-Darbots-SkyStone" target="_blank">Darbots-FTC-Lib</a>, and the Darbots Website.</p>
                <p>The programming subteam also records programming video tutorial series</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p class="lead">Building</p>
                <p>The building subteam builds prototypes as well as finalized versions of our competition robots as well as our outreach project robots / IoT devices</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p class="lead">Outreach / Business Team</p>
                <p>The outreach subteam connects with other teams and local communities to help build a better STEM community for the world.</p>
                <p>It manages our social media accounts and keeps track all of our outreach projects.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p class="lead">Research & Development Team (R&D)</p>
                <p>The R&D subteam reflects on our competition / experiment results and looks for inspirations to improve our robot throughout the season.</p>
                <p>It designs different robot iterations, verifies those designs with STEM skills we learned in school, and hand final designs to the building team.</p>
