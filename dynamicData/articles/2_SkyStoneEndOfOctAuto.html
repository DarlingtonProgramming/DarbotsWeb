    <p>This is our Blue Alliance Loading Site's Autonomous Programs for FTC Skystone 2019-2020 Season.</p>
    <p>As you can see our program has improved a lot over a short period. </p>
    <p>The first Autonomous was shot on Oct. 15 before our first meet. And the second Autonomous was shot on Oct. 24. </p>
    <p>We were able to keep our robot squared during autonomous by implementing Gyro-Guided Drives on top of Encoder-Controlled Drives.</p>
    <p>Our codes are completely open-sourced. See "Open-Source" link on top for more information.</p>
