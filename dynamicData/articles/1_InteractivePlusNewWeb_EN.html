    <h3>Upgrade Motivations</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The old website pages are just UGLY, Boost Framework has a wrong font + color selection</li>
    <li>The original website pages are hard to maintain, it requires a lot of work to translate between three languages. This website page is now developed as double language and has a built-in multi-lang news system.</li>
    <li>The old website pages had been used for 1 year, upgrade the website pages help the visitors to feel refreshed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technologies behind the website pages</h3>
    <p>As the introduction says, those new frameworks we utilize help us to improve our skills on commercial standard frameworks. Besides that, it helped us to have a deeper understanding of how great frameworks worked, so that we can improve on our own frameworks. </p>
    <p>This time, the technologies that we have improved:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dynamic HTML hot loading</li>
        <li>List dynamic hot loading based on Javascript-saved data</li>
    </ul>
